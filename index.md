# Conventions

Defined exclusively in terms of quaternions, the Wigner $\mathfrak{D}$
matrices and spherical-harmonic functions (spin-weighted and scalar)
are pretty simple, and easy to make internally consistent.  However,
it is important to establish which conventions are in use ---
especially in comparison to other source.  Here, I carefully examine
all the assumptions built in to the conventions for the
`spherical_functions` package, and relate these choices to those made
by other authors.
